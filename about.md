Welcome to a Saleana's blog :relaxed:

Hopefully you find something helpful or at least interesting here.

## About this Blog

Every programmer should have a personal website, so I may be a fake programmer for a couple of years.. Even though this is not an ideal (and there will never be one) platform for project demonstration - it is a blog to share learning experience rather than a showcase of achievements; and my obsessive compulsive disorder gets even worse due to aesthetic fatigue.. This is a awesome theme that I fell in love with at the first sight! Furthermore, this is my very first **website**. I should not be too supercritical about it.

## About Me

I am computer science student studying in Northeastern University, Boston, MA.. and I am too shy to share more!

Please contact me at [zhong.jia1@husky.neu.edu](mailto:zhong.jia1@husky.neu.edu) if you have any questions or fun thoughts to share about!
